# Powerplant Coding Challenge
This project is created in visual studio 2019 using .NET Core 3.1 framework and Angular8

## Required tools
1) NodeJs
2) Visual studio

## Installation

1) Unzip the Powerplant_Coding_Challenge.zip

2) Open the solution with Visual Studio

3) Click the start IIS Express button 

4) Visual studio will automatically download the required node_modules (if this for some reason is not happening see below for more info)

5) The application is running now

## Angular 8
For having some visual feedback I also created a front-end portal with Angular8

You can send a POST request with an editable body object

Several test scenarios can be created using the extra buttons

## Node Modules
Normally visual studio is automatically downloading the required node_modules using the package.json file.
If this is not happening you will need to download it yourself using npm.

1) Open command prompt
2) Change the directory to the folder "ClientApp"
3) Run the following command :

```
npm install
```
4) After a few minutes you can start the solution
